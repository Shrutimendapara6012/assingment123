Q-3 What is Express.js?
    Express.js is a popular and widely used web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalistic and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js is known for its simplicity, ease of use, and its ability to create robust web applications quickly.

    Express.js acts as a middleware layer on top of Node.js, simplifying the process of handling HTTP requests and responses. It provides a set of functions and tools that make it easier to define routes, handle requests, manage cookies and sessions, serve static files, and more.

    One of the key features of Express.js is its routing system. It allows developers to define various routes for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URLs. This makes it straightforward to handle different types of requests and perform actions based on the incoming data.
